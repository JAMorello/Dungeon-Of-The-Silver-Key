# Dungeon Of The Silver Key
## A basic Lovecraft inspired text-based dungeon crawler written in Python

This was my first actual project written in Python. I wrote it in January of this year when I knew nothing about classes, OOP, or basically anything beyond the basics of the language.

This project *DOES* reflect that. I have made no modifications (except making the inventory system functional) since I first wrote it.
It is poorly structured, strangely written, and has some formatting oddities in places. Nevertheless, it's fun to play and it reminds me how far i've come.

Side note: If you want to see how it was intended to look, run the .py version in pycharm, or anything that supports Figlet and colorama. The executable is black and white.

For anyone learning Python and attempting to make a text-based game like a few sources recommend:
* Feel free to use any portion of this code to help you along, especially the combat portions
* Don't give up and keep learning!
